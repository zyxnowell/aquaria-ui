This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to use

Make sure that you have the [aquaria-api](https://github.com/zyxnowell/aquaria-api) running.

In the project directory, you can run: `npm run start`.

CORS is only enabled on port:3007 so make sure you are running the app on port:3007. 

If you don't wish to run the app on port 3007 you can update the "PORT" variable on the `.env` file and the update the port specified on the index.js file of the api.
